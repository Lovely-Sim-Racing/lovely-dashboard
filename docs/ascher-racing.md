# Rotary Dials
The **Rotary Dials** in the center of the steering wheel can be used as simple rotaries, but with the advanced features of the Ascher Racing Artura Series, you can convert them into modifier switches. These modifier switches control the output of other buttons or rotaries on the steering wheel, thus giving you a vast number of inputs.

### Customise the Rotary Dials
You can customise the Labels shown on the screen of the Lovely Dashboard by using the [**Settings Configurator**](https://lsr.gg/config), additionally you can also purchase the [**Lovey Ascher Racing Sticker Sheet**](https://store.lsr.gg/collections/stickers) for the Ascher Racing Artura Series steering wheel.

> [!TIP]
> To initialise the Rotary Dials, you must first click the trigger button and then rotate the dial. This is necessary in order to capture the modifier mode. This is required only once per Simhub session, you will not be required to do this again until you restart Simhub.

# Device Settings
The **Ascher Racing Artura Series** steering wheels allow you to customise a few things on the wheel itself. Now, with the **Lovely Dashboard integration** you can see exactly what you're changing, along with useful information and instructions.

### Bite Point
To enter Clutch Bite Point mode, hold the right funky switch down for at least 1 second.

### Clutch Calibration
To enter Clutch Calibration mode, hold down the **two left or right buttons** to colibrate the **left or right paddle**. You have three seconds to pull on the appropraite paddle, at which point the steering wheel will exit and save the maximum travel.

Follow the on screen instruction to change the Analaogue Input Mode from **`Throttle / Brake`**, **`Slave / Master`** and finally **`Master / Slave`**. Save your selection by holding down the same buttons for at least 3 seconds.

Analogue Input mode will exit automatically without saving after 10 seconds.
