# Rotary Dials
The **Rotary Dials** in the center of the steering wheel can be used as simple rotaries, but with the advanced features of the Ascher Racing Artura Series, you can convert them into modifier switches. These modifier switches control the output of other buttons or rotaries on the steering wheel, thus giving you a vast number of inputs.

### Customise the Rotary Dials
You can customise the Labels shown on the screen of the Lovely Dashboard by using the [**Settings Configurator**](https://lsr.gg/config), additionally you can also purchase the [**Lovey Ascher Racing Sticker Sheet**](https://store.lsr.gg/collections/stickers) for the Ascher Racing Artura Series steering wheel.
