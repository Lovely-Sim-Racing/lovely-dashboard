</a>
</h4> 

## What's Included
In the [Releases](https://github.com/cdemetriadis/lovely-dashboard/releases) section, you will find:

1. **Lovely Dashboard** - A custom designed dashboard to use on your phone or dedicated DDU Screen
2. **Lovely Dashboard XL** - An oversized version of the Lovely Dashboard for the new 10" DDU Screens.
3. **Lovely Overlay** - If you're a streamer, you can use this overlay in OBS or any other broadcasting software
4. **Lovely Tower** - A leader board tower, great for OBS if you're streaming 
5. **Lovely Flags** - A "simple" dashboard to display race flags and platform integration

## Download & Install
This is a SimHub Dashboard, therefore **SimHub Dash** app is required to run it (Doh!). Also, since the UI was a considerate design, you will also need to download and install the **Roboto Font Family** from Google (free).

:people_holding_hands: **For more information, tips & feedback, please join the [Lovely Discord](http://j76.me/LSRDiscord)**
