### Step 2: Download and install the Lovely Plugin
**Download** the latest **Lovely Plugin** file (`LovelySimRacing.Plugin.dll`) from the [latest releases](https://github.com/cdemetriadis/lovely-dashboard/releases) or the [Lovely Website](https://lsr,gg/dash). Once the file is downloaded, you will need to **copy it into SimHub's root folder**, usually located at `C:\Program Files (x86)\SimHub\`. **Restart SimHub** and enable the Lovley Plugin at the prompt. Finally, **Select "Show in left main menu"**.

</p>

### Step 3: Download and install the Lovely Dashboard
Download any Lovely Dashboard that you'd like to use from the [latest releases](https://github.com/cdemetriadis/lovely-dashboard/releases) or the [Lovely Website](https://lsr,gg/dash). Once downloaded, double-click the `.simhubdash` file and follow the insctrucitons.

### Step 4: Setup your controls
One of the best features of the Lovely Dashbaord is that it has a multitude of options and screens to choose from. To take full advantage of all the Screens and Modules, you will need to assign certain actions to your steering or button box. Please make sure you assign all of the [**SimHub Action Triggers**](./docs/actions.md) in order to control the Lovely Dashboard.

### Step 5: Post-it Notes Simhub Plugin (Optional)
The Post-it Notes SimHub Plugin is deeply integrated into the Lovely Ecosystem, providing beter and more consistent data. It is an optional addition, but it does offer some very important upgrades to how SimHub calculates timing and gaps. Also, if you are an iRacig user, you will to install the Post-it Notes plugin to get infromation about your iRating. To install it, Download the latest release from the official [Post-it Notes Github Page](https://lsr.gg/postit), and repeat the same process as you did to **install the Lovely Plugin**.

## What is True Dark Mode?
**True Dark Mode** in the Lovely Dashboard is more than just pretty colors. Alongside a new theming architecture responsible for changing the colours and icons, True Dark Mode does more for you than you may think.

**Melatonin** is a hormone made in the body. It regulates night and day cycles or sleep-wake cycles. Darkness triggers the body to make more melatonin, which signals the body to sleep. Light decreases melatonin production and signals the body to be awake. 

In extended driving sessions, especially during the late hours, light may be scarce and the mind starts slipping into a night cycle. To counter the effect of melatonin and reduce the amounts produced in our body, we need to reverse the trigger by using colour hues that negate the melatonin. 

**Blue light not only suppresses melatonin, it also enables the circadian rhythm to help the body maintain alertness.**

Switching to the **Blue True Dark Mode** during these long low-lit driving stints would decrease the amount of melatonin in our body, maintaining alertness.

## Partnerships
