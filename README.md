> :people_holding_hands: **For more information, tips & feedback, please join the [Lovely Discord](https://lsr.gg/discord)**


## Settings
The Lovely Dashboard is a highly customizable dashboard. You can tailor it to your personal needs and adapt how it functions. To take full advantage of the Lovely Dashboard you'll need to copy the file `Lovely-Dashboard_settings.json` into the `./Simhub/JavascriptExtensions` folder. 

![Copy the settings file into the JavascriptExtensions folder](docs/images/settings-file.png)

To change your personal settings, you can either edit the file `Lovely-Dashboard_settings.json` directly in any text editor **OR** use the new [**Settings File Configurator**](https://lsr.gg/configurator).

The available settings are outlined in the dedicated [**Settings File**](./docs/settings.md) page.

## What is True Dark Mode?
**True Dark Mode** in the Lovely Dashboard is more than just pretty colors. Alongside a new theming architecture responsible for changing the colours and icons, True Dark Mode does more for you than you may think.

**Melatonin** is a hormone made in the body. It regulates night and day cycles or sleep-wake cycles. Darkness triggers the body to make more melatonin, which signals the body to sleep. Light decreases melatonin production and signals the body to be awake. 

In extended driving sessions, especially during the late hours, light may be scarce and the mind starts slipping into a night cycle. To counter the effect of melatonin and reduce the amounts produced in our body, we need to reverse the trigger by using colour hues that negate the melatonin. 

**Blue light not only suppresses melatonin, it also enables the circadian rhythm to help the body maintain alertness.**

Switching to the **Blue True Dark Mode** during these long low-lit driving stints would decrease the amount of melatonin in our body, maintaining alertness.

> [!TIP]
> To use True Dark Mode, you will need to [enable it in the Settings File](./docs/settings.md#true-dark-mode) and [setup your Hot-Key in Simhub](./docs/actions.md#setup-hot-keys).
