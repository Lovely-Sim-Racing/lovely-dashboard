## Installing
If this is your first time installing the **Lovely Dashboard**, please follow these steps, and make sure you've completed each before proceeding to the next one.

### Step 1: Download and install SimHub
Download & install [**SimHub**](https://www.simhubdash.com) app, just as you would install any other Windows application on your system. Follow the prompts and once it's installed, proceed to the next step.

### Step 2: Download and install the Lovely Plugin
**Download** the latest **Lovely Plugin Installer** from the [Lovely Website](https://lsr.gg/plugin). Once the file is downloaded, you will need to **double click** on the file and follow the instructions on screen. **Restart SimHub** and enable the Lovely Plugin at the prompt. Finally, **Select "Show in left main menu"**.

### Step 3: Install the Lovely Dashboards
Within the **Lovely Plugin**, navigate to the **Dashboard Manager** tab, and simply click on the dashboard you wish to install, follow the on-screen instructions.

### Step 4: Setup your controls
One of the best features of the Lovely Dashbaord is that it has a multitude of options and screens to choose from. To take full advantage of all the Screens and Modules, you will need to assign certain actions to your steering or button box. Please make sure you assign all of the [**SimHub Action Triggers**](https://store.lsr.gg/pages/help-simhub-actions) in order to control the Lovely Dashboard.

## Updating
If you have received a notification on your **Lovely Dashboard** of a new update, navigate to the **Dashboard Manager** tab and select the dashboard to update.

## What is True Dark Mode?
**True Dark Mode** in the Lovely Dashboard is more than just pretty colors. Alongside a new theming architecture responsible for changing the colours and icons, True Dark Mode does more for you than you may think.

**Melatonin** is a hormone made in the body. It regulates night and day cycles or sleep-wake cycles. Darkness triggers the body to make more melatonin, which signals the body to sleep. Light decreases melatonin production and signals the body to be awake. 

In extended driving sessions, especially during the late hours, light may be scarce and the mind starts slipping into a night cycle. To counter the effect of melatonin and reduce the amounts produced in our body, we need to reverse the trigger by using colour hues that negate the melatonin. 

**Blue light not only suppresses melatonin, it also enables the circadian rhythm to help the body maintain alertness.**

Switching to the **Blue True Dark Mode** during these long low-lit driving stints would decrease the amount of melatonin in our body, maintaining alertness.
